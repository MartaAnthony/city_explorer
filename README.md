# city_explorer

**Author**: Marta Anthony
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
The application is a stand-alone back end which interacts with a static front end. It requests data from a total of six third-party APIs, modifies the data, and sends the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. It provides data for the City Explorer Application, allowing a user to search for a location, present a Map, as well as interesting information about the area, all using data from APIs that the server will fetch and manage.
